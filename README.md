I have spent last 17 years in Higher Education but have now decided that I want to change my career path to my passion of Data Analysis. I am also in the process of writing my PhD up which has a focus on modeling oxygen response to intense exercise. I have a lot of expereince of designing and teaching Advanced Excel, VBA, Tableau and Power BI to undergraduate and postgraduate students and staff for a huge variety of disciplines and topics. I have also used my data skills for my research and supervising 100+ BSc and 35+ MSC and 6 staff projects. I would now like to use these data skills in private industry - with interests in NHS, Military, Blue light, GOV.uk, or energy companies but happy and comfortable to be in finance and or any business.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting project evidence together to clearly demonstrate skills i have refined over the last 20 years and also new additional ones.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science & Machine Learning with AiCore
